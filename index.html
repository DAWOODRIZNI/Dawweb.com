<p>One of Haiti's most powerful gangs is believed to be behind the kidnapping of 17 American and Canadian missionaries, a source in the Caribbean country's security forces told CNN Sunday.

  Authorities believe the "400 Mawozo" gang abducted the group, which included 16 Americans and 1 Canadian, after the missionaries visited an orphanage on Saturday in Croix des Bouquets, a suburb northeast of the Haitian capital, Port-au-Prince.
  As they were traveling from the orphanage towards Titanyen, north of Port-au-Prince, gang members stopped the vehicle at gunpoint.
  The 400 Mawozo gang has been growing in strength for the past three years, numbering up to 150 members, and has essentially taken control of Croix des Bouquets, the source in Haiti's security forces told CNN.
  Kidnapping for ransom is a hallmark activity of the gang. They have abducted dozens of people this year alone, including foreign nationals, the source said.
  Once notorious for car theft, the 400 Mawozo has pioneered "collective" kidnappings of large groups of victims from buses and cars, according to the Center for Analysis and Research for Human Rights (CARDH), a Port-au-Prince-based nonprofit.</p>

  <p>Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) has reportedly laid down new red lines for the Democratsâ€™ multi-trillion reconciliation bill, this time making demands regarding the expanded child tax credit provision.

    Axios reported on Sunday, citing people familiar with the matter, that Manchin informed the White House that the child tax credit must have an "established work" requirement and a family income limit in the $60,000 range if Democrats want his vote for the package.
    
    Those demands, Axios noted, would significantly weaken the child tax credit, which is one of President Bidenâ€™s key programs to assist working families. It would also bring down the price tag of the spending bill, which Manchin and fellow moderate Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) have both said is too high.</p>
